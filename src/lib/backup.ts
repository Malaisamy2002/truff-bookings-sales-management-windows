/**
 * Saves a backup to disk. In the browser/PWA this is a Blob + `<a download>`

 * Save dialog via `tauri-plugin-dialog` + `tauri-plugin-fs`; returns the path
 * the user chose, or `null` if they cancelled the dialog.
 *
 * Android is matched before the generic desktop branch and does NOT use that
 * Save dialog: `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s `save()` hands back a `content://`
 * URI on Android that `tauri-plugin-fs`'s `writeFile()` cannot write to — it
 * does not throw, it just silently produces a 0-byte file (see
 * `saveExportFile`'s doc comment in desktop.ts). That's a real correctness
 * risk here specifically, since `archiveYear` in archive.ts (which shares
 * this same dialog+fs pattern) deletes local rows once its own download
 * reports success — a silently-empty backup would mean deleted data with no
 * usable copy anywhere. Android instead writes through the bundled
 * `android-save` plugin straight into the public Downloads folder, with no
 * dialog and thus no "cancelled" outcome — just saved or not.
 *
 * The file this writes is encrypted (see `encryptFullBackupBytes` in
 * backup-crypto.ts) — this is the single-file `.db` export people are most
 * likely to copy to a USB drive, email, or drop in a shared cloud folder, so
 * it gets the same AES-256-GCM treatment the Telegram full backup and year
 * archive already had; there's no plaintext branch left. `encryptFullBackupBytes`
 * throws a clear, actionable error if no backup passphrase has been set yet
 * (Settings → Backup encryption) rather than silently falling back to
 * plaintext.
 *
 * Kept async (the browser branch always did the work synchronously, so
 * existing unawaited call sites keep working unchanged) so BackupCard/
 * ArchiveCard can `await` it to know whether a desktop save was cancelled
 * (or an Android save failed).
