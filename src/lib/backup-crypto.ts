/**
 * AES-256-GCM encryption for backup payloads.
 *
 * `telegram-backup.ts` packages the whole ledger (customers, bills,
 * expenses, receipt photos) into one archive and hands it to a third party
 * — a Telegram chat, or the local filesystem if it's later shared/copied.
 * Neither Telegram nor an on-disk copy needs to be able to read that archive
 * for the backup/restore flow to work, so it's encrypted client-side before
 * it leaves the device and decrypted client-side after it comes back. This
 * module is that encrypt/decrypt step; it knows nothing about Telegram or
 * the archive's internal shape (zip vs. JSON) — callers pass it raw bytes.
 *
 * Container format (all multi-byte integers big-endian):
 *   4 bytes   magic "TSLE" (Turf Snack Ledger Encrypted)
 *   1 byte    format version (currently 1)
 *   4 bytes   PBKDF2 iteration count
 *   16 bytes  PBKDF2 salt
 *   12 bytes  AES-GCM IV
 *   N bytes   AES-256-GCM ciphertext (the last 16 bytes are GCM's own
 *             authentication tag — Web Crypto appends it automatically and
 *             `decrypt` verifies it, which is what turns "wrong passphrase"
 *             and "corrupted/tampered file" into a clean rejection instead
 *             of silently returning garbage plaintext)
 *
 * The passphrase itself never travels in the container or anywhere near
 * Telegram — only the derived key is used, and only in memory.
